# Shadow Self - Youth Mental Wellness AI

Hi! We are **Synergetic AI Team**, a group of five students registered for this project. 
My name is Anurag Pathak, and I am one of the team members.  

**Important note:** This project is **personally done by me**. 
Although I am part of a group, the other team members did not communicate or collaborate on this project. I made the entire AI Project and all the code myself as a student participating in the Google Hackathon.  

This project is called **Shadow Self**. It is a simple AI made to help youth with mental wellness. Sometimes, young people feel stressed, lonely, or scared to talk about their feelings. Shadow Self is like a **friendly big brother** that listens and gives advice.

## How Shadow Self Works

- You type your thoughts or problems in a box on a web page.  
- Shadow Self reads what you type and gives a supportive answer.  
- Example prompts and responses:

  - **Input:** "I feel stressed before exams"  
    **Shadow Self:** "It’s normal to feel nervous before exams. Take deep breaths and focus on one thing at a time."  

  - **Input:** "I feel lonely"  
    **Shadow Self:** "Even if you feel alone, reaching out to one trusted friend can help."  

  - **Input:** "I’m scared to talk about my family"  
    **Shadow Self:** "It can be scary, but sharing with someone you trust is a good start."  

  - **Input:** "How do I build confidence?"  
    **Shadow Self:** "Start small, celebrate little wins, and remember everyone learns at their own pace."  

- If the input does not match any specific prompt, Shadow Self gives a **friendly general reply**:  
  `"Thanks for sharing. I’m here to listen. Can you tell me more?"`

Notes
Shadow Self is not a professional therapist. It’s just a friendly AI to encourage youth to talk about their feelings.
It is beginner-friendly and works offline — no API key or internet needed.
This project is completely developed by me, as a single participant in the hackathon.

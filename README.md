# Shadow Self - Youth Mental Wellness AI

Hi! We are **Synergetic AI Team**, a group of five students registered for this project. 
My name is Anurag Pathak, and I am one of the team members.  

**Please Notee** This project has been developed compeletly by me. While I am part of a team, my fellow members did not contribute to this specific project. 
I created the entire AI project and wrote all the code independently as a participant in the Google Hackathon.

The is name of this Ai and project is Shadow Self. 
It is a simple and straightforward AI designed to support youth in their mental wellness journeys. 
Young individuals often experience feelings of stress, loneliness, or apprehension when discussing their emotions. 
Shadow Self acts like a caring older sibling who listens and offers guidance.

## How Shadow Self Works

- You type your thoughts or problems in a box on a web page.  
- Shadow Self reads what you type and gives a supportive answer.  
- Example prompts and responses:

  - **Input:** "I feel stressed before exams"  
    **Shadow Self:** "It’s normal to feel nervous before exams. Take deep breaths and focus on one thing at a time."  

  - **Input:** "I feel lonely"  
    **Shadow Self:** "Even if you feel alone, reaching out to one trusted friend can help."  

  - **Input:** "I’m scared to talk about my family"  
    **Shadow Self:** "It can be scary, but sharing with someone you trust is a good start."  

  - **Input:** "How do I build confidence?"  
    **Shadow Self:** "Start small, celebrate little wins, and remember everyone learns at their own pace."  

- If the input does not match any specific prompt, Shadow Self gives a **friendly general reply**:  
  `"Thanks for sharing. I’m here to listen. Can you tell me more?"`

Notes

It is beginner-friendly and works offline — no API key or internet needed.
This project is completely developed by me, as a single participant in the hackathon.
